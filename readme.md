# Pusher
A very simple client for requests to the [PushOver API](https://pushover.net/) to get yourself a notification from your program.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Enter your User and Application API-Token in the `src/main/java/pusher/Pusher.java`.
3. Build a jar:
   - with `jar cf Pusher.jar src/main/java/pusher/Pusher.java` or 
   - with your IDE tools.
4. Add the jar as a libary or simply copy paste the code.
